# ðŸ“¦ Inventory Analytics in Retail Industry

This project explores intelligent inventory management and demand forecasting in the retail sector. It compares classical ARIMA models with deep learning-based LSTM models to forecast product demand and pricing trends, followed by a rule-based inventory optimization and dynamic pricing strategy.

## ðŸ“Š Problem Statement
Retail businesses often struggle with demand fluctuations, stockouts, and overstock. This project addresses:
- Product-level demand forecasting
- Inventory replenishment
- Dynamic pricing
- Real-time decision-making via dashboards

## ðŸ§  Key Technologies
- ARIMA (Statistical Time Series Forecasting)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Networks)
- Rule-Based Inventory Optimization
- Dynamic Pricing Logic
- Python (pandas, statsmodels, keras, matplotlib)
- Data Visualization Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Contributions
- ðŸ“ˆ **Demand Forecasting:** Compared ARIMA and LSTM, where LSTM outperformed with RMSE: `10.51` vs ARIMAâ€™s `11.71`.
- ðŸ’° **Price Prediction:** LSTM used to forecast price based on historical pricing and promotional patterns.
- ðŸ§® **Inventory Optimization:** Reorder points and thresholds defined using forecasted demand.
- ðŸ’¡ **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjusted pricing based on demand-inventory balance.
- ðŸ“Š **Dashboard:** Interactive UI showcasing inventory levels, price recommendations, and forecast insights.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset Overview
- Historical sales by product and region
- Weather and promotion metadata
- Product and store features

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

| Model | RMSE | MAE | MAPE |
|-------|------|-----|------|
| ARIMA | 11.71 | 9.31 | 6.65% |
| LSTM  | 10.51 | 8.50 | 6.35% |
